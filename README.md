# What is this?

This is a small project to further practice Redux and challenge myself with passing props to animations using styled-components. It's not in any way done, and I don't know if it ever will. One goal is to make my own API one day.

## Learning objectives

- How to make API calls around Redux using thunks
- Passing props into key frames in styled-components
- How to structure your redux store to suit your data

## Tech

- JSX
- Styled-components
- React
- Redux
- API
